Author: Gary Clark
Date: 6 Oct 2017

This application was written as a project for the Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree program.
The application initially shows a grid of movie posters for the most popular movies as retrieved
from the MovieDB web site.  The user can choose to show "most popular" movies, or "top rated" movies
by selecting the category in the application menu.  Users can then see details for a selected movie
by "clicking" on the desired movie's image.

MOVIEDB API KEY REQUIRED
In order to use this application, users will have to enter their personal "api_key" for the MovieDB
web site in the "..\PopularMovies\app\src\main\res\values\strings.xml" file.  The project can then
be built and run.
